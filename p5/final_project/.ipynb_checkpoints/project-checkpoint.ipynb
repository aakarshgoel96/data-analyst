    "## Identifying Fraud from Enron Emails \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I used python's scikit-learn library that consists of various machine learning algorithms to build person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. This data has been combined with a hand-generated list of persons of interest (POI) in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.\n",

Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those? **\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to choose a combination of features, financial and email, of former Enron employees and choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm to predict whether that person is considered a person of interest (POI) or not. It should be noted that this dataset contained labeled data where POIs were flagged and as such the purpose of this project is to build a supervised classification model that could be used on other unlabeled datasets.\n",

    "The Enron dataset contained 146 records with 14 financial features, 6 email features, and 1 labeled feature for POI. Out of the latter dataset, 18 people were labeled as persons of interest (POI). Interestingly, I had to omit email_address from the email features list due to it being a string while all the other features were integer values; it was hard to justify keeping unique email addresses as a POI identifier for fraud. Furthermore, I visualize the dataset's feature to conduct some basic exploratory data analysis. \n",
