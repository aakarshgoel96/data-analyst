    "## Identifying Fraud from Enron Emails \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I used python's scikit-learn library that consists of various machine learning algorithms to build person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. This data has been combined with a hand-generated list of persons of interest (POI) in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.\n",

    "Run poi_id.py to view the selected and tuned feature selections, and the machine learning algorithms' performances. Run tester.py to view the performance of the chosen algorithm, K-nearest neighbors classifier. The following is a snippet of the scores returned from tester.py"

    "** Q1 Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those? **\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to choose a combination of features, financial and email, of former Enron employees and choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm to predict whether that person is considered a person of interest (POI) or not. It should be noted that this dataset contained labeled data where POIs were flagged and as such the purpose of this project is to build a supervised classification model that could be used on other unlabeled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enron dataset contained 146 records with 14 financial features, 6 email features, and 1 labeled feature for POI. Out of the latter dataset, 18 people were labeled as persons of interest (POI). Interestingly, I had to omit email_address from the email features list due to it being a string while all the other features were integer values; it was hard to justify keeping unique email addresses as a POI identifier for fraud. Furthermore, I visualize the dataset's feature to conduct some basic exploratory data analysis. \n",

    "** Q2 What features did you end up using in your POI identifier, and what selection process did you use to pick them? Did you have to do any scaling? Why or why not? As part of the assignment, you should attempt to engineer your own feature that does not come ready-made in the dataset -- explain what feature you tried to make, and the rationale behind it. (You do not necessarily have to use it in the final analysis, only engineer and test it.) In your feature selection step, if you used an algorithm like a decision tree, please also give the feature importances of the features that you use, and if you used an automated feature selection function like SelectKBest, please report the feature scores and reasons for your choice of parameter values.**\n",

    "I have used two existing features 'poi' & 'shared_receipt_with_poi' also generated two new features from existing features i.e 'fraction_to_poi' & 'fraction_from_poi' these were the fractions of messages sent and recieved by poi's.\n",
    "These new features are made because they depict features in more proper and required form suitable to find the results.\n",
    "I chose these features by analyzing the dataset manually and from lectures in the course and selected them randomly which gives best result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a min-max scaler, StandardScaler. The scaler was very important to normalize the data as features had different units and varied widely by several orders of magnitude in some cases. Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators: they might behave badly if the individual feature do not more or less look like standard normally distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).\n"
